# PRSLSpockV2
The Lizard / Spock Expansion

A more polished version of my initial Paper / Rock / Scissors game.

Added the "Lizard" and "Spock" options as seen in the Big Bang Theory TV show
Created multiple Opponent profiles who play differently, including some "hidden" opponents who only show up when "random" is chosen.
added soundbytes for wins, losses, and ties
improved error catching for bad input
added a simple score tracker
