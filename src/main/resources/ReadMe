2nd version of my Paper / Rock / Scissors program

Inspired by the first functionality, I wanted to expand the game to include the "Lizard/Spock" elements as seen in The Big Bang Theory

I added different opponents who play different ways; Sheldon only plays Spock, Stuart always loses, that kind of thing
I also wanted to apply what I have learned using other classes, maps, and method calling

Notes for next version:
add a menu system to allow replays, shows rules
keep win/loss record within playthrough
keep score with a text document read/write (export scores to sql table?)
unlockable achievements? (you tied 100 times! you can play joshua from wargames!)
